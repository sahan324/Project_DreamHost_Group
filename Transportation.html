    <h1>üöß The Challenges Facing Public Transport Today</h1>
    <p><b>
        Inconsistent Real-Time Information</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Issue: Most public transport systems fail to offer accurate, real-time tracking of buses, trains, and other vehicles. Passengers are left guessing about arrival times, leading to frustration and inefficiency.
        <br>
        Impact: Wasted time for passengers, missed connections, and increased vehicle congestion.
    </p><br><br>
    <p><b>
        Inefficient Ticketing Systems</b>
    </p>
    <p>Issue: Traditional paper ticketing and manual fare collection are cumbersome, slow, and prone to human error. This results in long queues, missed sales opportunities, and the potential for fraud.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Impact: Reduced efficiency, customer dissatisfaction, and revenue loss.</p><br><br>

    <p><b>Inadequate Passenger Engagement</b></p>
    <p>Issue: Many systems fail to provide proactive communication with passengers, leaving commuters uninformed about delays, emergencies, or changes in schedules</p>
    <p>Impact: Passenger anxiety, missed rides, and overall dissatisfaction with the public transit experience.</p>
